# AI-Trained Snake Game with Deep Q-Learning

This project implements an AI agent trained with Deep Q-Learning to play the classic Snake game. The agent learns to navigate the snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with itself and the game boundaries. The game environment is built using PyGame, and the neural network model is implemented with PyTorch.

## Features

- **Snake Game Environment:** Built using PyGame, featuring a playable Snake game with a graphical interface.
- **Deep Q-Learning AI:** Utilizes a neural network implemented in PyTorch to train the AI agent.
- **Training and Visualization:** Tracks and visualizes AI training progress and gameplay metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyGame
- PyTorch
